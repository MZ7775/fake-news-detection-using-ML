This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). The dataset consists of labeled real and fake news articles, which are preprocessed by removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying techniques like TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features. A Logistic Regression model (or other classifiers like Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, or LSTM for deep learning) is trained on this data to distinguish between fake and real news. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Once trained, the system can classify new articles based on their textual content. This project highlights the use of AI in combating misinformation and can be deployed as a web app or API for real-world usage.
